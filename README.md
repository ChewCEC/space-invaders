# Raylib-Quickstart
A simple cross platform template for setting up a project with the bleeding edge raylib code.
Works with C or C++.

# Output files
The built code will be in the bin dir

# Working directories and the resources folder
The example uses a utility function from `path_utils.h` that will find the resources dir and set it as the current working directory. This is very useful when starting out. If you wish to manage your own working directory you can simply remove the call to the function and the header.
